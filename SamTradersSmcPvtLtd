Supported file formats - Manufacturer Center Help
Google currently supports uploading data files in both tab-delimited and XML formats. See below for instructions on creating each file type.

Tab-delimited file instructions
Tab-separated values, or TSV, files are one of two supported file formats for Manufacturer Center. Most TSV files are created using spreadsheet programs. You'll include the attribute names in the first row (i.e. header) separated by a tab. Then starting on the second row, include the corresponding values under each attribute name. We recommend using a spreadsheet program such as Google Sheets or LibreOffice to create and save tab-delimited files.

Create your data file
Step 1: Open your spreadsheet program

Use a spreadsheet program such as Google Sheets. This makes it easy to create a data file and convert it to the proper format.

Step 2: Create a header row

On the first row of the spreadsheet, enter the names of the attributes that describe your products, each in its own column. Include all the required attributes and any relevant recommended attributes.

An example using some sample attributes in the header row would look like this:

 	A	B	C	D	E	F
1	
ID [id]

Brand [brand]

Title [title]

GTIN [gtin]

Description [description]

Image link [image_link]

Step 3: Enter your item information

In the rows below the header row, enter information about your items for the attributes you've chosen. Each item should be listed in a separate row, and its information divided into the appropriate columns. (For example, a product's description should be in the same column as the "description" header.)

 	A	B	C	D	E	F
1	ID [id]	Brand [brand]	Title [title]	GTIN
[gtin]	Description [description]	Image link [image_link]
2	123-yelbr	Acme Toys	Acme Toys - Yellow Bear	001234567890	Sample description	link.com/pic
3	456-redbr	Acme Toys	Acme Toys - Red Bear	001234598760	Sample description	link.com/pic
Step 4: Convert your spreadsheet

Most spreadsheet programs allow you to export data into a tab-delimited file. Either of the options below will create a file with a name ending in the .tsv extension. This is the file you should submit to Manufacturer Center.

If you're using Google Sheets:
From the File menu, select Download as and then .Tab-separated values (.tsv, current sheet). Your tab-delimited text file will be displayed in a new window.
Name your file, and be sure to specify the file type as a .tsv if it gives you the option. Click Save.
If you're using LibreOffice:
Select File > Save as....
Select format Text CSV (.csv). Though it says CSV, it actually generates all kinds of text files.
Check Edit filter settings. Click Save. If a warning appears, continue with the Text CSV format.
In the new pop-up, leave Character set as Unicode (UTF-8); change Field delimiter to {Tab} from the dropdown; delete the value in Text delimiter; leave the other checkboxes as they are and click OK.
If you've already registered a feed in your Manufacturer Center account, use the same file name that you specified during the setup process.

Step 5: Submit your file via a data feed

Check that your file meets our format requirements below and submit it to us.

Format Requirements
The file must be tab-delimited.
The first line of the file is the header -- it must contain attribute names, separated by tabs.
One item per line; separate each attribute in that line by a tab.
Do not include trailing tabs at the end of lines.
Do not include tabs or line breaks in the attributes themselves.
Formatting repeated attributes
The following attributes are repeated attributes:

A repeated attribute is one that accepts more than one value.

Values of a repeated attribute must be separated by a comma.
If a value of a repeated attribute contains a comma, it must be encapsulated by straight double quotes.
Product type [product_type]
“Home & Garden > Kitchen, Dining & Table > Appliances > Refrigerator”, Household Appliances > Kitchen > Refrigerator
If a quoted value contains a double quote, it must be doubled.
"Sharp 7"" tablet screen (323 pixels per inch)", "Long lasting battery, up to 9-10 hrs of active use", Quad-core speed and performance with 2GB RAM, Comes with Android 4.3
The following attributes are repeated group attributes:

A group attribute is one that has sub-attributes.

The product detail attribute has three sub-attributes:
Section name [section_name]
Attribute name [attribute_name]
Attribute value [attribute_value]
Headline [headline]
Text [text]
A group attribute is provided by providing values for all of its sub-attributes separated by a colon.

Like repeated attributes, values containing a comma, and also values containing a colon, must be encapsulated by straight double quotes. Also, quotes within quoted values must be doubled.
Feature description [feature_description]
Enhanced zoom with new release:The newest generation comes with enhanced zoom to show you more of the world around you.:"http://example.com/image1.png",Sharper resolution:"The product now comes with 15""display that is 10X sharper than our previous releases, and it has a 3.5X zoom.":"http://example.com/image2.jpg"
XML file instructions
Extensible Markup Language (XML) provides a flexible framework for encoding structured data in a format which is both human- and machine-readable. Google recommends using XML files if you have a product information management (PIM) system with robust export capabilities.

Google supports an extended version of RSS 2.0 with standard attributes linked to their respective sections in the official RSS 2.0 specification to assist you in finding additional information about the components from our examples. Although Google provides examples of RSS 2.0 files, we provide minimal details about RSS 2.0 itself. Learn more about this standard at http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss.

Section 1: RSS 2.0
Based on the RSS 2.0 specification, there are three pre-defined elements at the item level - title, link, and description. Although these elements are optional in the RSS 2.0 standard, product data feeds require them.

Product data feeds also require additional elements such as ID [id], brand [brand], and GTIN [gtin]. To include these elements and more detailed information about a product, Google extended RSS 2.0 by adding the Manufacturer Center feed namespace. Defining the Manufacturer Center namespace allows you to use additional elements, called "attributes", and increases the amount of information you can provide about each product in a feed.

Below is an example of a basic RSS 2.0 document containing a single product:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

The two major additions in this example are the addition of the namespace declaration [xmlns:g="http://base.google.com/ns/1.0"] and the inclusion of Manufacturer Center attributes, such as GTIN [gtin], MPN [mpn], suggested retail price [suggested_retail_price], and release date [release_date].

Manufacturer Center namespace declaration

The following namespace declaration is required in order to use attributes defined only in the Manufacturer Center namespace: [xmlns:g="http://base.google.com/ns/1.0"]

In addition to declaring the Manufacturer Center namespace, you must also include a prefix within every attribute tag. We add this prefix to attributes to distinguish attributes defined in our namespace from elements defined in RSS 2.0. The prefix selected for this namespace declaration is "g": <g:image_link>http://www.google.com/images/google_sm.gif</g:image_link>

Attributes in the Manufacturer Center namespace must include this prefix or the attributes, and any values they contain, will be ignored.

Attributes

You can use as many relevant attributes as are specific to your products. Supplying additional information about your products by using these attributes will greatly increase your items' chances of showing up in Shopping ads results. In addition, many attributes defined in the Manufacturer Center namespace can be used more than once within a single product. This enables you to include more available information about a product in your data file.

Section 2: Important Checklist
Before you submit your file, Google highly recommends checking this list to help ensure your file is properly formatted:

The feed filename you register in your Manufacturer Center account must match the name you assign to your file.
Remember to include the following namespace declaration: [xmlns:g="http://base.google.com/ns/1.0"]
Verify the prefix included in the Manufacturer Center attribute tags matches the prefix defined in the namespace declaration.
Remove attributes that do not contain any values.
Section 3: Final Note
The sample entry included in this document was simplified to allow for clearer focus on the basics of constructing an XML product data file. While Google accepts data files containing other elements defined in the RSS 2.0 standard or in your own namespace, any information these elements contain will be ignored during processing and will not appear in your listings. At this time Google will only process data contained in the default RSS 2.0 elements and in attributes within the Manufacturer Center namespace.

Create a new feed - Manufacturer Center Help
In order to upload your product data in Manufacturer Center, you'll first need to create a feed to which you can submit your data. This step is required for any new feed, and once a feed is created, you can update the existing feed without having to create it again.

How it works
Primary feeds
A primary feed is the required data source that Manufacturer Center uses to display your products on Google.

For example:

ID [id]	Title [title]	GTIN [gtin]	Brand [brand]
1	shirt	343234567890126	Brand A
2	shoes	468013579357	Brand B
3	hiking boots	680246913579	Brand C
4	pants	9504000059437	Brand A
You can overwrite your entire product data feed by creating and resubmitting another data file as a primary feed under the same feed name.

Use primary feeds to add or remove product data, and set language and country targeting for your product data. Primary feeds are the only feed type that can add or remove products.

Create a primary feed
Supplemental feeds
Supplemental feeds provide additional, or supplemental, data that can be connected to existing product data in the primary feed. Supplemental feeds cannot add or remove products, or be used as a standalone feed; instead, they're used to update existing product data. Supplemental feeds can also provide additional information to multiple primary feeds.

To use a supplemental feed, connect it to existing primary feed through the ID [id] attribute used for products in the primary feed. Supplemental feeds will only update your product data when the supplemental feed contains IDs that already exist in a primary feed.

Example
Primary feed
ID [id]	Title [title]	MSRP	Brand [brand]
1	shirt	34	Brand A
2	shoes	55	Brand B
3	hiking boots	100	Brand C
4	pants	75	Brand A
Supplemental feed
ID [id]	Color [color]
1	RED
4	BLACK
Resulting feed
ID [id]	Title [title]	MSRP	Brand [brand]	Color [color]
1	shirt	34	Brand A	RED
2	shoes	55	Brand B	-
3	hiking boots	100	Brand C	-
4	pants	75	Brand A	BLACK
Create a supplemental feed
